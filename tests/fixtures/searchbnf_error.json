shortdesc = Computes the sum of all numeric fields for each result.
description = If "row=t" (default if invoked as 'addtotals') for each result, computes the arithmetic sum of all\
              numeric fields that match <field-list> (wildcarded field list).\
              If list is empty all fields are considered.\
              The sum is placed in the specified field or "Total" if none was specified.\
              If "col=t" (default if invoked as 'addcoltotals'), adds a new result at the end that represents the sum of each field.\
              LABELFIELD, if specified, is a field that will be added to this summary \
              event with the value set by the 'label' option.
comment1 = Compute the sums of the numeric fields of each results.
example1 = ... | addtotals
comment2 = Compute the sums of the numeric fields that match the given list, and save the sums in the field "sum".
example2 = ... | addtotals fieldname=sum foobar* *baz*
comment3 = Compute the sums of all the fields, and put the sums in a summary event called "change_name".
example3 = ... | addtotals col=t labelfield=change_name label=ALL
commentcheat = Calculate the sums of the numeric fields of each result, and put the sums in the field "sum".
